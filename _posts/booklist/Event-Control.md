Event-triggered control is an idea that appears pleasing theoretically, as well as relaxes the need to have periodic signalling - robotics, it would reduce computation and communication loads. The assumption of periodicity seems overly strong, and creates complications when violated (jitter, etc). Having a control scheme that does require periodic execution could be advantageous.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Event-triggered control consists of closing the feedback loop whenever a predefined state-dependent criterion is satisfied. This paradigm is especially well suited for embedded systems and networked control systems since it is able to reduce the amount of communication and computation resources needed for control, compared to the traditional periodic implementation. In this paper, we propose a framework for the event-triggered stabilization of nonlinear systems using hybrid systems tools, that is general enough to encompass most of the existing eventtriggered control techniques, which we revisit and generalize. We also derive two new event-triggering conditions which may further enlarge the inter-event times compared to the available policies in the literature as illustrated by two physical examples. These novel techniques exemplify the relevance of introducing additional variables for the design of the triggering law. The proposed approach as well as the new event-triggering strategies are flexible and we believe that they can be used to address other event-based control problems.
