Abstract: This article is part of a series commemorating the 50th anniversary of Ed Lorenz's seminal paper
'Deterministic nonperiodic flow'. The system he studied has become the object of extensive
mathematical investigations and serves as a paradigm of a low-dimensional chaotic dynamical system.
Nonetheless, Lorenz maintained his focus on the relationship between dynamical models and empirical
data. This paper reviews some of the difficulties encountered in fitting chaotic models to data
and then pursues fits of models with stable periodic orbits to data in the presence of noise.
Starting with Lorenz's model in a regime with a stable periodic orbit, it investigates how well
properties of the deterministic system can be recovered from trajectories of stochastic perturbations$
A numerical study suggests, surprisingly, that the stability properties of the periodic orbit
cannot be fully recovered from a finite length trajectory as the magnitude of the stochastic
perturbation converges to zero. A heuristic framework for the analysis is developed and shown
empirically to yield good estimates for the return map of the periodic orbit and its eigenvalues
as the length of a stochastic trajectory increases.
