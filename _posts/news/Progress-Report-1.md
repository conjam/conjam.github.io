Professor Revzen has been working with his collaborator Samuel Burden on extending the theory
of smooth oscillators (differential equations having smooth vector fields and
limit cycle behavior) to "hybrid" oscillators which aren't smooth, or even continuous.
This research is of interest for many applications. One such application is to 
legged locomotion (of animals, people, robots, etc.) -- it is convenient to 
model locomotion as a piecewise-smooth oscillator with discontinuities in its vector 
field resulting from ground-leg contact, as this removes the need to explicitly
model extremely complicated impact dynamics.

In January of 2014, we gave a talk at the annual meeting of the Society
for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, TX to present 
an application of this research. 

Consider the following observation. When represented in state space, 
the set of states representing "multiple-contact" events (when more 
than one leg contacts the ground simultaneously) constitute a set of measure
zero. Therefore, generically speaking, we would not expect to
 observe this behavior in animals -- yet, we do. The purpose of this talk
at SICB was to explain how the aforementioned theory of hybrid oscillators
may help to explain this phenomenon.

####Abstract
<br><br><br>
 The trot and pace gaits of quadrupeds and the alternating tripod gait 
of running hexapods are just the most familiar of the many multiple contact 
gaits that multilegged animals utilize. We define “multiple contact gaits” 
to be those in which multiple legs touch down with near simultaneity. 
Arguments of collision angle suggest that such gaits are inherently less 
energetically efficient than rotary gallops and metachronal gaits. We 
present new results from dynamical systems theory which suggest that multiple 
contact gaits benefit from a unique, hitherto unknown, form of stability which 
makes them particularly robust to uncertainties in muscle actuation and ground 
traction. We conjecture that this advantage, conferred by the inherent the 
structure of the mechanical dynamics, accounts at least in part for the 
convergent appearance of multiple contact gaits across virtually all terrestrial 
animal taxa.
