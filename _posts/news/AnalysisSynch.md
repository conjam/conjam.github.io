Abstract: Many physical and biological oscillators are coupled indirectly through a slowly evolving dynamic 
medium. We present a perturbation method that shows that slow dynamics of a coupling medium is 
effectively equivalent to weak coupling of oscillators. Our methods first apply the theory of 
averaging to obtain a periodic solution to a single system and then exploit small fluctuations 
around the mean to analyze coupling between systems. We use this method to explain the 
spike-to-spike asynchrony seen in a model for bursting neurons coupled through extracellular 
potassium and to explore synchronization in a model for quorum sensing.
