level: graduate

title: Ph.D Candidate
major: "Electrical Engineering: Systems, focus: Control" 
bio:  A third-year graduate student, George Council orginally entered the University of Michigan as a terminal Master's student, but was sufficiently enticed by honeyed promises of low pay, long hours, and interesting problems to switch to a PhD student in the Winter of 2013. With an undergraduate degree from Montana State University in electrical engineering, he'll occasionally lay claim to that title, but has interests ranging from abstract math to field ecology. His primary responsiblities include breaking things and asking questions.  
education: "B.S. in Electrical Engineering 2012 - Montana State University, Bozeman. M.S. in Electrical Engineering: Systems 2013 - University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."
quotes: "Uhhhh. Okay? Is this a trick question? I don't understand. Who put a docx file in here, Satan? I don't like beetles because they're too juicy. Let's start a fire! This is brain cancer-inducing. Seems good to me boys!  Better than stick in the eye, they say, or death by firing squad if you're into that. "
