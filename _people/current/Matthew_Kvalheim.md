title: Ph.D Candidate
major: Electrical Engineering
bio: "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan. Most of my research involves the application of ideas from dynamical systems theory to the study of biological/robotic systems. My current projects include (A) developing a framework for embedding simple models in higher-dimensional state spaces in a way which respects dynamics, and (B) writing code to compute linearizing 'normal forms' in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit of an empirically observed dynamical system in a data-driven fashion. Other interests of mine include topology, geometry, and mathematical physics."
education: "B.S. Electrical Engineering, Ohio University, 2013."
